# Confectionery website sketches

## Overview

Quickly sketch your ideas for the layout of your confectionery website for all screen sizes. Similar to what we did in the [Sketching a website](https://learntheweb.courses/courses/web-dev-1/sketching-a-website/),  [C’mon do the sketchin’](https://learntheweb.courses/courses/web-dev-1/cmon-do-the-sketchin/) & [Paper plans](https://learntheweb.courses/courses/web-dev-1/paper-plans/) activities.

**Do sketches for all screen sizes: `small`, `medium` & `large`**

### 1. Sketch the layout

- *Layout* — Quickly sketch what you want your final website to look like.
- *Draw boxes* — Determine what things will become HTML elements.
- *Determine extra groups* — Figure out if we need extra grouping boxes to make the layout.
- *Write semantics* — Assign each box a semantically appropriate HTML tag.
- *Apply basic CSS* — @media, display, width, position, etc.

### 2. Match patterns

Similar to our [Finding patterns](https://learntheweb.courses/courses/web-dev-1/finding-patterns/) activity, figure out which assignments match as close as possible to what you want to code.

- Write the matching assignment on your sketches as a reference for yourself when you start coding.
